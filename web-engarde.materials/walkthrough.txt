=== SOLUTION ===

Here’s the minimal solution for “En Garde”.

A few hints:

* You can’t type commands. The keyboard isn’t used in this game; chuck it out the window.
* Before tossing it, check under the window to be be sure that no one is below.
* During the game, colored boxes will appear.
* Each color coresponds to a command.
* It’s up to you to figure out what command each color represents.
* Don’t worry — you can’t put the game into an unwinnnable state, so feel free to experiment.
