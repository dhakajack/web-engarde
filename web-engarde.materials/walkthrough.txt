=== SOLUTION: EN GARDE ===

Accessibility: The game has been designed for accessibility, with some features only visible to users employing screen readers or voice synthesizers. Game play should be the same regardless of mode of access. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulties related to accessibility at engarde@templaro.com.

Navigation: If you prefer to use the keyboard versus mouse, it should be possible to tab or shift-tab between hyperlinks. In testing, this works best in Chrome and Opera.

A few hints:

* You can’t type commands. The keyboard is of no use in that regard; chuck it out the window.
* Before tossing it, check under the window to be be sure that no one is below.
* During the game, some colored buttons will appear.
* Each color corresponds to a command. 
* It may help to note each color and its corresponding command.
* It’s up to you to figure out what command each color represents.
* Don’t worry -— you can’t put the game into an unwinnnable state, so feel free to experiment.

Walkthrough:

Goal 1: Moar Brains! 

The first goal is to find something with more brains than you (a low bar) and eat it. When you move from your initial location, a mouse will run past you. Return to the starting room and pop it into your mouth. Yum. A little gross maybe, but the zombie palette is not discerning.

Goal 2: Man’s Best (Tasting) Friend

Mouse brains will only get you so far in unlife. You’re looking for an upgrade and will need to “borrow” some brains from a dog to the north of the east-west hallway. When you are as east as you can go, you will note that there is a potential exit to the north. However, there is a wall there. To move north, you will have to use new commands (open and then north) that you learned from the mouse brain.

Goal 3: Lower Level

Fido knows one trick: pushing things. When you get back to the main east-west hallway, a potential exit is shown to the east, but again there is a wall there, so you can’t just walk east. There is a red glowing button on that wall, and you should do what comes naturally: press it. That will call the elevator. Enter the elevator and press the green button on the panel in the elevator to change floors, then walk out.

Goal 4: High brow humor

You are now on the lower level of the complex in a hall similar to the one on the upper level. You can move freely to the south, so why not check it out.

Goal 5: A slice of life

You should be back in the east-west hallway of the lower level now. Again, north is listed as a potential exit, but there is a wall there. Drawing on what you learned from the mouse, you can again open it and proceed north. There, you will find a refrigerator. Open the fridge and the item contained therein to reveal a slice of brain. Yes.

Goal 6: Unlock the future

Seven colors is a lot to remember, and now that you are at least mildly literate, you can just read the labels on the command buttons. Also, the skill you just acquired from the slice of brain will literally open up some new doors for you. When you return south to the east-west corridor of the lower level, you will notice that west is now listed as a potential exit. Attempting to open that door results in a message that it is locked, so you unlock it and proceed west. Same situation in the locker room, unlock the door north and climb the stairs.

Goal 7: Reunited

You’re an old hand at unlocking doors, so when you get to the top of the staircase, unlock this one and proceed north into the airlock, where you will meet the scientist. There hasn’t been anyone to talk to up to this point, but now that there is, a new command appears: talk. Trying to eat the scientist right off will get you whacked with a crowbar repeatedly, so ease into it with some conversation first.

Goal 8: Fix Synthesis Unit

The goal for the rest of the game is to manufacture a dose of the cure to the zombie virus. You’ll need a machine in a lab on the upper floor of the facility, so you have to to back track down the stairs, east across the lower level hallway, take the elevator to the upper floor, and then unlock the door to the south, to access the lab. If you open the access panel on the synthesis machine, you’ll see the problem and can use your new repair skill to fix a short circuit. 

On the way to the lab, at the bottom of the stairs, you may notice an electrical panel. If you open it, you’ll see that the circuit breaker for the synthesis lab has flipped. If you try to repair the circuit breaker before fixing the short circuit in the lab, the breaker will just flip again, so order does matter here.

Goal 9: Let the Juice Flow

Now that the machine has been repaired, the next step is to restore electrical power to the lab. The circuit breaker is found in an electrical panel at the base of the stairs to the airlock. Go back to the lower level, all the way west to the decontamination room (until recently referred to as the locker room) and then go one room to the north. Open the electrical panel and use “repair” to reset the circuit breakers. Current should now be flowing to the lab.

Goal 10: The Cure

Head back to the synthesis lab, where the cure will be waiting for you. As soon as you get there, you automatically drink it. Cheers.

Goal 11: Report to the Control Room

Now you just have to convince the folks in the control room that you have succeeded in finding a cure to the zombie virus. You’ll need to navigate back to the lower level, all the way west to the stairs, and then northward on the stairs to the airlock. There, you will activate the intercom by pushing it and then talk with the control room staff until they are convinced to release you from the locked down airlock.

THE END.

To replay the game, just reload it in your browser. 

A final hint: The colors randomize on each play reflecting the confused and illiterate state of the zombie mind. The order of the commands remains the same, however, from game to game (i.e. “east” will always be the first command button).
