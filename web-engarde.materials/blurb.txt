Description: 

A man who has lost his memory.

A mouse who has lost his realm.

A dog who has lost his family.

And the scientist who will save the world.

Content Warning: While the game strikes a generally humorous tone, some parts of it could be disturbing, particularly to very young players. There's some violence towards animals and humans, and I suppose you could even make a case for a bit of cannibalism. I could see how that might upset some people. If you think you're in that category, have a friend play it first.
